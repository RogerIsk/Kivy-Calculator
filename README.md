# Kivy-Calculator

### A calculator made with a python and a kivy file which later get combined to create 1 single python calculator file that works with kivy

### The calculator is fully operational and it works with insanely big numbers:
 example: 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 + 123
       = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000122

### While working with said big numbers it allows the user to scroll with the mouse up and down and use
### an unlimited amount of new lines (as long as your device can handle it)

### It also accepts keyboard commands such as CTRL+C, CTRL+V, CTRL-A, Space, Backspace, Enter (new line).
### The user can also manually input the signs (+, -, *, /) and the calculator will accept them and solve.
