# Kivy-Calculator

### A calculator made with a python and a kivy file which later get combined to create 1 single python calculator file that works with kivy

The calculator is fully operational and it works with insanely big numbers:
 example: 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 + 123
       = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000122

While working with said big numbers it allows the user to scroll with the mouse up and down and use
 an unlimited amount of new lines (as long as your device can handle it)

It also accepts keyboard commands such as CTRL+C, CTRL+V, CTRL-A, Space, Backspace, Enter (new line). 
 The user can also manually input the signs (+, -, *, /) and the calculator will accept them and solve.
